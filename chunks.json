    "Little Red Riding Hood Little Red Riding Hood was a girl who always wore a red hood made by her grandmother. One day, her mother asked her to take a basket of food to her grandmother, who was ill, recommending that she follow the safe path through the forest and not talk to strangers. On the way, the girl meets a wolf, who asks where she is going. Innocently, she reveals her destination and ends up distracted, straying from the path to pick flowers. The wolf, faster, goes straight to the grandmother's house, tricks her, and captures her. Then, he takes her place in bed, disguising himself to wait for Little Red Riding Hood. When a girl arrives, she finds the \"grandfather's\" appearance strange, but only realizes the danger too late, noticing that it is the wolf. Before anything worse happens, a hunter—who is passing through the forest—enters the house upon hearing the noises, rescues the grandmother, and saves Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf is prevented from continuing to do evil, and the girl learns an important lesson: to obey her mother's instructions and never trust strangers."
